# IoT-Project
Repository for the IoT project.

You are required to perform a patrolling task on the given target points.
Each target has a certain amount of time in which it has to be patrolled.
If a drone does not patrol a target in the given time, the target is considered "expired".

At each second, you get a score of 1 point for every target which is not expired.
You can get points for a total of 120 seconds of simulation time.

Can you write a code to achieve the best score?



You can start the project just by running:

```
./start
```

Your solution should go in:

```
/src/iot_project_solution
```
